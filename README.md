# TengenToppaAnimango

New version of the [aniMango]() site for the University of Warwick Anime and Manga Society.

This is the code that runs [animesoc.co.uk](https://animesoc.co.uk).

Built on Django 3.1 and Bootstrap using a large amount of code from the old site.

---

### Running the Project

To run the site locally for development, you should set up a virtual environment running Python 3.8.5 and install all
the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` . Additionally, you will need a MySQL server running in the same 
format as the one on the server.

This repository contains all the files needed to run the site, except for the config files, which future webmasters will
need to copy to their machine from the server.
