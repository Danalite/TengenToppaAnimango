# TengenToppaAnimango

New version of the [aniMango](https://github.com/WarwickAnimeSoc/aniMango) site for the University of Warwick Anime and Manga Society.

This is the code that might someday run [animesoc.co.uk](https://animesoc.co.uk).

Built on Django and Bootstrap using a large amount of code from the old site.

## Running the Project

To run the site locally for development, you should set up a virtual environment running Python 3.8.5 and install all
the necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` . Additionally, you will need a MySQL server running in the same 
format as the one on the server.

This repository contains all the files needed to run the site, except for the config files, which future webmasters will
need to copy to their machine from the server.

## Todo

#### Homepage
__*Progress:*__  Not started. However, all the other functionality needed to add this page is now present. Will probably add this at the end when I get around to doing styling a layout work.

#### User Accounts
__*Progress:*__ All the basic user functionality has been added. Need to implement the Library app to add the loans section of the profile.

#### Events
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### Showings
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### News
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### Library
__*Progress:*__ Not started. There's a chance that the library might be sorted and re-catalogued at the start of term 1 this year, so i'll probably wait until then to reimplement the import command.

#### Karaoke
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### History/Exec
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### Archive
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### Stream
__*Progress:*__ All functionality is present. Needs some improvements to the user interface.

#### Other
The site needs to be styled so it doesn't look like a default bootstrap site.
